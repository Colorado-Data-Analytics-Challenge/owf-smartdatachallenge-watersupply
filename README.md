## Overview of Problem and Solution

The Open Water Foundation (OWF) solution focuses on using public water datasets from
several sources to better understand challenges and opportunities related to municipal water use efficiency,
with impact being to focus funding and innovation on water providers that could benefit the most.

Datasets used in the solution include:

* State of Colorado's [Water Efficienecy Data Portal](http://www.cowaterefficiency.com)
* Climate data from the [Regional Climate Center Applied Climate Information System](http://www.rcc-acis.org/)
* [Municipal data from the Open Water Foundation](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-data-co-municipal-water-providers)
and see also other [OWF datasets](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/)
* [Population data from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/data/)
* Useful data and insight from [South Platte and Metro Basin Stories](http://southplattebasin.com/colorado-water-plan/stories/).

Datasets are analyzed using tools developed by OWF as part of
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](http://cdss.state.co.us/) and OWF research and development.
The approach shown in the challenge solution demonstrates the use of statewide datasets as data infrastructure,
reproducible and automated analysis workflows,
and visualizations and stories to provide insight.
By using large-scale datasets coupled with subsets of data for cohorts of water providers,
it is possible to understand the context of water use and potential for increased efficiency.
By analyzing and visualizing the datasets from multiple perspectives,
it is also possible to gain context and identify challenges, opportunities, and data quality issues.

The overall solution is a combination of data, tools, and process that provides insight.

## About the Open Water Foundation

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that focuses on open source software and open data solutions to make better water decisions.
Water is a public resource and we believe that data and software about water should
also be public (to the point that it transitions to customer and private systems).
We also believe that open innovation solutions and collaboration can lead to
better solutions in less time.

***Open data, Open software, Open decisions.***
