## Overview of Problem and Solution

The Open Water Foundation (OWF) solution focuses on using public water data from
several sources, including:

* State of Colorado's [Water Efficienecy Data Portal](http://www.cowaterefficiency.com)
* Climate data from the [Regional Climate Center Applied Climate Information System]()
* [Municipal data from the Open Water Foundation](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-data-co-municipal-water-providers)
and see also other [OWF Datasets](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/)
* [Population data from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/data/)

These data are analyzed using tools developed by OWF as part of
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](http://cdss.state.co.us/).
The approach shown in the challenge solution demonstrates the use of statewide datasets,
reproducible and automated analysis workflows,
and visualizations ans stories.
By using large-scale datasets coupled with more granular datasets for cohorts of water providers,
it is possible to understand the context of water use and potential for increased efficiency.
By analyzing and visualizing the datasets from multiple perspectives,
it is also possible to identify challenges, opportunities, and data quality issues.

The overall solution is a combination of data, tools, and approach that provides insight.

## Presentation and Online Story Prototype

OWF's challenge entry presentation is available as:

* [PowerPoint-generated PDF](CO_AnalyticsChallenge_2018_OpenWaterFoundation.pdf)
* [Online interactive story](http://stories.openwaterfoundation.org/co/smart-data-analytics-challenge-2018) - best viewed on a desktop computer with large display

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the presentation PDF and this README file.
Because the work presented here represents an increment that leverages significant previous work,
access to that work has been provided as links in the presentation and online story.

## About the Open Water Foundation

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that focuses on open source software and open data solutions to make better water decisions.
Water is a public resource and we believe that data and software about water should
also be public (to the point that it transitions to customer and private systems).

***Open data, Open software, Open decisions***
